# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `get_element_details` returns `floorPlanPolygons: []` and a note when Tapir finds no cut
  fill for an element, instead of silently leaving the key out.

- Fix: `list_properties` always returned an empty list. Archicad returns the IDs under
  `propertyIds`, not `properties` (found in the first live test, Archicad 30 build 3001).

- Phase 0: connection with one reused HTTP client, discovery of several instances with
  project name and Tapir state, nine read-only tools, simulated Archicad and CI.
